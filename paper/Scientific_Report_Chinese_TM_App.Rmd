# Introduction (David)

- short intro

- motivation: historic impact of news

- intro to structure of People's Daily

- motivation: People's Daily is the governing Chinese Communist Party's Major Outlet


## Current Situation in China (David)

- End of 2019: Trade war with the US

- 2020: Covid-19



# Data Sources 

## Text Data (Nils)

- short and general info

About one year and three month of data. Scraped from the free archive of [Peoples Daily](http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb). A more detailed explanation of the scraping process is added in the method section \ref{sec:Methods} The app includes an automated updating routine that expands the database scraping directly from paper.people.com.cn.

## Economic Data (Eyayaw)



# Construction of the Application

## Scraping process for original database (Nils)

- idea, process and issues we encountered


## Translation from Chinese (David)


## Economic data retrieval (Eyayaw)

- Where, what and how did we get it.

- This can be very short.


## Exploratory statistics, visualisation, and text mining (Eyayaw)
Start with simplest descriptives and plots, e.g.:

- most common non-stop words with frequencies

- compare pre- and post-corona common words

- pre-post word clouds with translated words

- two-word correlation

- time-series frequency plots (very important)


Optional:

- bigram graph

- two-word correlation with phi-coefficient

- lda/topic model (very optional)

Do not:

- sentiment analysis


## Shiny user interface (David)



# Results

Here we should show some of the results of our application. As discussed before COVID-19 will be most likely the centre of our examples but maybe we can show here the mentioned theory of the shadow page as well



# Discussion

How could we improve the app? Extend the archive? Add more economic data? Implement some other statistical information?

Encrypted server version



# Conclusion

Summary of our application and our results. Do we have plans to expand and update the app further in the near future?



Just an idea, because they want it scientific, let's include a bunch of references to the data mining book, etc., just if you find some that would make sense.
