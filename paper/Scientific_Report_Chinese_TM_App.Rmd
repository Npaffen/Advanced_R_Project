# Introduction

This will be a short introduction into the topic. Maybe cite some big historic impact of news on the economy- (Maybe watergate affiar or some other disclosure repots of a news paper). Then a introduction into the structure of the chinese newspaper we looked into. Maybe notice that it is highly swayed be the government of the People's Republic of China.

# Curent (economic?) situation in China

Here we might add some background information about the current situation in china and the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak.


# Data Description
About one year and three month of data. Scraped from the free archive of [Peoples Daily](http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2020-04/01/nbs.D110000renmrb_01.htm). A more detailed explanation of the scraping process is added in the method section \ref{sec:Methods} The database will be updated daily with the newest paper issue.





## Structure of the Application


# Scraping process


# Text Mining, exploratory statistics and visualisation



# Shiny application



#Results
Here we should show some of the results of our application. As discussed before COVID-19 will be most likely the centre of our examples but maybe we can show here the mentioned theory of the shadow page aswell
#Discussion
How could we improve the app? Extend the archive? Add more economic data? Implement some other statistical information?

# Conclusion

Summary of our application and our results. Do we have plans to expand and update the app further in the near future?
